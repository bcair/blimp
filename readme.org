* Blimp - Bustling Image Manipulation Package
Blimp is a complete wrapper around all imagemagick commands with descriptions, autocompletion (for some commands) and hints displayed in prompt using eimp.el to execute its commands and resize images.

#+html: <img src="screenshot.png" alt="Blimp command building"/>

** Features
- Supports all imagemagick commands
- Supports all completion frontends (ivy, helm, ido, etc)
- Writes changes to buffer instead of file allowing you to revert changes before saving
- Parameter autocomplete for some commands
- Description of command in prompt
- Description of input format for some commands
- Resize images to fit window or manually using the mouse

** Install
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'blimp)
  (add-hook 'image-mode-hook 'blimp-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Usage
First enter a image-buffer and type =C-c C-o= to bring up the =blimp-interface=. After choosing a imagemagick command and its parameters, do =C-c C-e= to apply the chosen command(s) on the current image or =C-c C-r= to clear all queued commands. You can also do =C-c C-O= to apply the command right after selecting it and =C-c C-p= to toggle the current command prefix between "+" and "-".

If you want to resize the current image to fit the buffer you have several alternatives: =M-x eimp-fit-image-height-to-window= or =M-x eimp-fit-image-to-whole-window= or =M-x eimp-fit-image-to-window= or =M-x eimp-fit-image-width-to-window=

** Configuration
If you want to skip using =blimp-interface= and instead have hotkeys for specific commands you can do
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Prompts for amount of degrees to rotate then applies the rotation
  (defun my/blimp-rotate()
    (interactive)
    (blimp-interface-execute "rotate"))

  (define-key eimp-mode (kbd "C-c C-r") 'my/blimp-rotate)
#+END_SRC

Or if you want to run commands with all their paramaters already set
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Rotates image 90 degrees when called
  (defun my/blimp-rotate-90()
    (interactive)
    (blimp-add-to-command-stack (list "-rotate" "90"))
    (blimp-execute-command-stack))

  (define-key eimp-mode (kbd "C-c C-r") 'my/blimp-rotate-90)
#+END_SRC

To resize images using the mouse you can do
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key blimp-mode-map (kbd "<down-mouse-3>") 'eimp-mouse-resize-image-preserve-aspect)
  (define-key blimp-mode-map (kbd "<down-mouse-2>") 'eimp-mouse-resize-image)
#+END_SRC
